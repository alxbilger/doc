### Hierarchy ###
Files are parsed in alphabetical order to generate the online documentation. To change some file/folder order in the hierarchy, you can simply edit its number.

- 10_Folder_A
    - 10_File_AA.md
    - 20_File_AB.md
    - 30_File_AC.md
- 20_Folder_B
    - 21_File_BA.md

Will become

- Folder A
    - File AA
    - File AB
    - File AC
- Folder B
    - File BA

### Naming ###
Page title and URL depend on file name.  
File name become page title following these principles: 10_Folder_A -> Folder A  and  10_File_AA.md -> File AA  
File name become page url following these principles: 10_Folder_A -> folder-a  and  10_File_AA.md -> file-aa  

**WARNING**: Changing file or folder names (except numbers and case) will change page URL. Use with caution.
