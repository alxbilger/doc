TransformPosition
===============

This component belongs to the category of [Engines](../../../../simulation-principles/engine/). The TransformPosition engine transforms the positions of one DataFields into new positions after applying a transformation. This transformation can be either:

-   Projection on a plane (plane defined by an origin and a normal vector)
-   Translation, rotation, scale and some combinations of translation rotation and scale
