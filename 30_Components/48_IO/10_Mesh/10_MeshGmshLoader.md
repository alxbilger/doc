MeshGmshLoader
==============

This component belongs to the category of the [MeshLoaders](../../../../simulation-principles/topology/#meshloaders).

The MeshGmshLoader loads a mesh from a file under the format \*.msh. Such a mesh file can be either surface or volumetric meshes. The \*.msh meshes can be generated using software like [Gmsh](https://gmsh.info/).
To be noted, an interesting [project couples SOFA and Gmsh in python](https://github.com/sescaida/gmsh-sofa_tutorial) for applications such as parametric design or design optimization.

Usage
-----

**No pre-requisite** in your scene to use a MeshLoader.
